He is a graduate of the Juilliard School in New York, where he worked with famed pianist pedagogue Rosina Lhevinne, and later studied in Italy, directed by Beethoven expert Wilhelm Kempff and at the Mozarteum in Salzburg, Austria. Roman’s great passion is education and he is currently “Professor Emeritus” of the Dana School of Music of Youngstown State University in Youngstown, Ohio, USA, a position he has held for 39 years. Roman also conducts master classes and workshops for local piano students and teachers during the course of his travels. He has played concerts and conducted master classes in more than 100 countries. Since 1979 he has visited Australia every two years, playing more concerts here than in any other country – approximately 550 at last count! <br/> The more advanced the student, the better this masterclass will work! </p>

          		<p>Our Parish Priest, Fr Mick Peters, is trying to development and foster a community for our 6 PM Vigil Mass at St Josephs on the Strand. 
I'm helping by organising an event format, where I invite our members to bring a plate for a buffet and I provide music, or friends who can sing or perform. 
Now that we are achieving some success, we need more people who can sing or play music. 
I'm open to any kind of singing or performing so long as it is not too controversial. My preference would be for an artist to sing a medley of old time favorites. </p>

                <p> The Music Centre have a series of Sunday afternoon concerts at C2 and Friends of the Theatre have regular variety concerts at Pimlico PAC, also on Sunday afternoons. Because these venues have no foyer space, the theatre has to be open about an hour before the concert, so that audience members don't have to stand outside in the sun, wind, and rain... Instead of playing bland recorded music before the show, we prefer to have student musicians playing on stage when the doors open.  </p>

           		<p>For the musicians, this is effectively a practice session with a live audience; they don't have to "perform", they can stop and start as they please. They need to be of reasonably high standard, but they don't have to be polished performers. About 15 minutes before the concert start time, our compere introduces them, acknowledges the contribution of their school, and the curtain closes. The students are then welcome to stay for the concert. 

The students are considered volunteers, but we can help pay for expenses incurred. 

Small instrumental groups are preferred. The offer is open to all schools, so we need to schedule in advance. 

FOTT have 6 concerts per year, the Music Centre about 10. 

If you would like to take part, please let us know so we can send you a list of concert dates as soon as they are confirmed. Call us on 4724 2086 or <a href="mailto:admin@townsvillemusic.org.au?subject=About%20us%20page">Email Us</a></p>
