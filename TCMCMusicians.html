          		<p>Poms from Oz are Judy, Kathleen and Alan Pomeroy, a family of solo vocalists from North Queensland, Australia. All are dinky di Oz with Judy and Kathy being descendents of First Fleeters. Their tight harmony and vocal strength bring a fresh feel to original, contemporary and traditional works, uncovering a rich tapestry of songs gathered in their travels from around the world. Most songs are a cappella but sometimes accompanied by guitar and/or harmonica. </p>

           <div class="columnThree">
           		<p> Moods in their songs range from downright to real tear jerkers and audience participation is encouraged. Their sound is distinctive, as Judy arranges all the songs specifically for their voices. A tasty brew of Oz songs and Oz voices, with a dash of guitar and harmonica. Open a nice bottle of red, sit back and enjoy. For further information or bookings contact the Music Centre 4724 2086</p>

         		<p>The concept of the Camerata Singers originated in the 1980s when Susan Grinsell, who was teaching voice at James Cook University realised that ensemble singing was sadly lacking for tertiary music students. Since then, Susan, along with repetiteur Carol Dall'Osto, has strived to bring quality ensemble singing to the wider community by performing at events from the Ingham Italian Festival through to Cotter's Markets in the mall.
